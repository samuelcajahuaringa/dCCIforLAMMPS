# Nonequilibrium Free-energy calculation of Phase-Boundaries using LAMMPS
We provide the code that supports the numerical tests reported in the manuscript [Stochastic sampling of the isothermal-isobaric
ensemble: phase diagram of crystalline solids from Langevin dynamics simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10727)

This is a fortran codes for performing simulations in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble with isotropic volume fluctuations for two toys models
and also the fully flexible cell case for a bidimensional model that display a solid-solid phase transition.
